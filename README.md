# Recession Resilience
This project examined whether university towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions. The findings are presented in [recession_resilience.ipynb](https://github.com/iDataist/Recession-Resilience/blob/master/recession_resilience.ipynb). 

The raw date are stored in three different files. 

* From the [Zillow research data site](http://www.zillow.com/research/data/) there is housing data for the United States. In particular the datafile for [all homes at a city level](http://files.zillowstatic.com/research/public/City/City_Zhvi_AllHomes.csv), [City_Zhvi_AllHomes.csv](https://github.com/iDataist/Recession-Resilience/blob/master/City_Zhvi_AllHomes.csv), has median home sale prices at a fine grained level.
* From the Wikipedia page on college towns is a list of [university towns in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_college_towns#College_towns_in_the_United_States) which has been copy and pasted into the file [university_towns.txt](https://github.com/iDataist/Recession-Resilience/blob/master/university_towns.txt).
* From Bureau of Economic Analysis, US Department of Commerce, the [GDP over time](http://www.bea.gov/national/index.htm#gdp) of the United States in quarterly intervals is in the file [gdplev.xls](https://github.com/iDataist/Recession-Resilience/blob/master/gdplev.xls).
